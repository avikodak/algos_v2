Dictionaries ADT
	It is an ADT which stores elements such that it can be located very quickly using keys
	A dictionary stores key element pairs
	The main operation supported by dictionary is searching by key
	Simple container methods
		size
		isempty
	Query Methods
		findElement(k)
		findAllElement(k)
	Update Methods
		insertElement(key,element)
		removeElement(key)
		removeAllElement(key)
Unordered dictionary
	Keys are comparable only for equality ie we cannot say whether K1 > K2 or K1 < K2 .
	Doesnt support min,max,predecessor,successor
Dictionary ADT can be implemented
	Array
	Linked list
	Hashtable
	Binary Trees
	Red black trees
	AVL trees
	B-Trees
Searching
	returns index of the key if present or nill
	Linear search
		Traverse the entire array
		Execution time O(N)
	Binary Search
		Divide and conquer strategy
		Only on sorted array
		Execution time O(LogN)
In an unsorted array the search takes
	Worst case O(N)
	Average case O(N)
Unsorted sequence
	Searching & removing O(N)
	Inserting O(N)
	Used in logfiles,SystemAdministration (rare search / remove but insertion are very frequent)
Sorted sequence
	Seaching - O(logn)
	Insertion & Removal - O(N)
	Used in application where there are frequent searches but rare removals and insertions
Direct Addressing
	Takes O(1) time
	Huge amount of space
	Space O(r) - for complete range 
Hashing
	Excepted time = O(1)
	Space O(n+m)
	Like an array but come with the function to map the large range into one which we can manage
		Ex : Take the original key modulo the size of the array and use that as an index
	Collision
		If two keys maps to same location
	Collision Resolution Techniques
		Use chaining
Analysis of hashing
	An element with key K is stored at index h(k)
	The hash function h maps the Universe U of keys into the slots of hash table T[0 .. m-1]
		h:U->T[0 .. m-1]
	Time to compute hash function for k h(k) is O(1)
	A good function is one which distributes keys evenly amongst the slots
	An ideal hash function would pick a slot uniformly at random and hash the key to it
	However this is not a hash function since we would not know which slot to look into when searching for key
	Given hash table T with m slots holding n elements the load factor of the hash map is defined as alpha = n/m			
Unsuccessful search 
	Element is not in the linked list
	Simple hashing yields an average list length alpha = n/m
	Expected number of elements to be examined is alpha
	Search time O(1+alpha)
Successful search
	Assume that the new element is inserted at the end of the linked list
	Upon insertion of the ith-element the expected length of sill (i-1)/m
	In case of a successful search the expected number of elements examined is one more than the number of elements examined when sought for element is searched
	(1/n)Sigma(1ton)(1+(i-1)/m))
Assuming the number of hash map slots is proportional to the number of elements in the table
	n =O(m)
	alpha = n/m = O(m)/m = 1
	Searching takes constant time 
	Insertion = O(1)
	Deletion = O(1)
