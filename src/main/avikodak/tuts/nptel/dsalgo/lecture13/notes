2-4 trees
	They are search tree (but not binary trees)
	They are also known as 2-3-4 trees because they can have 2 or 3 or 4 children
	
Multiway search tree
	A tree in which each node can have more than one child but satisfies a search propery are called multiway search tree
	Each internal node of a multi way search tree T
		has atleast two children
		Stores a collection of items of the form (k,x) where k is the key and  x is an element
		contains d-1 items , where d is the number of children
		Has pointers to d children
	Children of each internal node are between items
	All keys in the subtree rooted at the child fall between keys of those items
Multiway searching
	Similar to binary searching
		if search key s < k1 search the leftmost child
		if s>kd-1 search the rightmost child
		Find two keys ki-1 and ki between which s falls and search the child vi
	Inorder traversal gives the sorted order of keys
Properties
	At most 4 children
	All the leaves are at the same level
	Search tree everything on left is less than root node and everything on right child is greater than root node
	At most height log4(N) and minimum height log2(N)
Insertion
	All the nodes get inserted at the leaf nodes
Deletion 
	All the predecessor are at the leaf nodes
Summary
	The height of a (2,4) tree is O(logn)
	Split, transfer and merge each take O(1)
	Search insertion and deletion each take O(logn)
