2-4 trees
    They are search tree (but not binary trees)
    They are also known as 2-3-4 trees because they can have 2 or 3 or 4 children
    
Multiway search tree
    A tree in which each node can have more than one child but satisfies a search propery are called multiway search tree
    Each internal node of a multi way search tree T
        has atleast two children
        Stores a collection of items of the form (k,x) where k is the key and  x is an element
        contains d-1 items , where d is the number of children
        Has pointers to d children
    Children of each internal node are between items
    All keys in the subtree rooted at the child fall between keys of those items
Multiway searching
    Similar to binary searching
        if search key s < k1 search the leftmost child
        if s>kd-1 search the rightmost child
        Find two keys ki-1 and ki between which s falls and search the child vi
    Inorder traversal gives the sorted order of keys
Properties
    At most 4 children
    All the leaves are at the same level
    Search tree everything on left is less than root node and everything on right child is greater than root node
    At most height log4(N) and minimum height log2(N)
Insertion
    All the nodes get inserted at the leaf nodes
Deletion 
    All the predecessor are at the leaf nodes
Summary
    The height of a (2,4) tree is O(logn)
    Split, transfer and merge each take O(1)
    Search insertion and deletion each take O(logn)
