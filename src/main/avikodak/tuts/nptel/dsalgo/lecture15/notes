Insertion into red black tree
	Let k be the key being inserted
	As in the case of a BST we first search for k this gives us the place where we have to insert k
	We create a new node with key k and insert it at this place
	The new node is colored red
	Since inserted node is colored red black height of the tree remains unchanged
	However if the parent of the inserted node is also red then we have a double red problem
	There would be two cases when the parent of the inserted node is red node
		case 2
			The parent of b could also be red.In that case the double red problem moves up a level
			Eventually we might color the root red
			In this case we recolor the root black.This increases the black depth of every external node by 1
 	In both insertion and deletion we need to make at most one rotation
 	We might have to move up the tree but in doing so we recolor nodes
 	Time taken is O(logn)
