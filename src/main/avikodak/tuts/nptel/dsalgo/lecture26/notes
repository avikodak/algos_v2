    Bipartite graph 
Bipartite graph
    G = (V,E) undireced graph is bipartite if there exists a partition of V into U and W V = U u W such that every edge has one end point in U and other end point in W

    Do a BFS starting from a arbitrary vertex v
    BFS divides the vertices into various levels
    BFS divides all the edges of the graph which go adjacent levels or within a level . There wont be any edges which jump levels
    Suppose all edges go between adjacent levels i.e no edge has both end points in the same level
    If in the BFS we find an edge both of whose endpoints are in the same level then graph is not bipartite
        if in the bfs we find an edge both of whose endpoints are in the same level then the graph has a odd cycle
        if we have a odd cycle then the graph cannot be bipartite
    If all cycles in a graph G are even then G is bipartite
    O(V+M)
In a BFS starting from vertex v the level number of the vertex u is the length of the shortest path from v to u
Diameter(G) = Maximum distance between two vertices in G
              Distance between two vertices = length of the shortest path between two vertices
              Maximum level number <= Diameter(G) <= 2 * Maximum level number in any BFS
