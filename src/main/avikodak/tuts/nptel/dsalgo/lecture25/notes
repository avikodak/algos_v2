Data Structures of graphs
	Edge list
	Adjacency lists
	Adjacency matrix  
	A graph can be represented by storing the vertices and the edges into two containers and each edge object has references to the vertices it connects
Edge list
	The edge list structure simply stores the vertices and the edges in two unsorted sequences
	Easy to implement
	Finding the edges incident on a given vertex is inefficient since it requires examining the entire edge sequence
Adjacency list(traditional)
	adjacency list of a vertex v 
		sequence of vertices adjacent to v
	Represent the graph by adjacency list of all the vertices
	Space O(N + Sigma(deg(v))) = O(N+M)
Adjacency list(modern)
	The adjacency list structure extends the edge list structure by adding adjacency list to each vertex
Adjacency Matrix (traditional)
	Matrix M with entries for all pairs of vertices
	M[i,j] = true means that there is an edge (i,j) in the graph
	M[i,j] = false means that there is no edge edge (i,j) in the graph
	There is an entry for every possible edge therefore Space = O(n^2)
Adjacency Matrix (modern)
	The adjacency matrix structures augments the edge list structure with a matrix where each row and column corresponds to a vertex
Graph Searching algortithm
	Systematic search of every edge and vertex of the graph
	Graph G = (V,E) is either directed or undirected 
	Applications
		Compilers
		Graphics
		Maze-solving
		Mapping
		Networks 
			Routing,searching,clustering etc
Breadth first search
	A BFS traverses a connected component of a graph and in doing so defines a spanning tree with serveral useful properties
	BFS in an undirected graph G is like wandering with a string 
	The label of any vertex v corresponds to the length of the shortest path from s to v
	Time Complexity
		Given a graph G = (V,E)
			Vertices are enqueued if there color is white
			Assuming that en and dequeuing takes O(1) time the total cost of this operation is O(V)
			Adjacency list of a vertex is scanned when the vertex is dequeued 
			The sum of the lengths of all lists is O(E) 
			Initializing the algorithm taks O(V)
		Total running time O(V+E) (linear in the size of the adjacency list representation of G)
BFS Properties
	Given an undirected graph G = (V,E) BFS discovers all vertices reachable from a source vertex s
	For each vertex v at level i the path of the BFS tree T between s and v has  at least i edges
	If (u,v) is an edge then the level numbers of u and v differ by at most one
	It computes the shortest distance to all reachable vertices
