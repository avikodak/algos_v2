Red black trees
	A red black tree is a binary search tree in which each node is colored red or black
	The root is colored black
	A red node can have only black children
	If a node of the BST does not have a left and/or right child we add an external node
	External nodes are not colored
	The black depth of an external node is defined as the number of black ancestors it has
	In a red black tree every external node has the same black depth
Two prolems
Double red problem
	Two reds occuring consecutively
Black height not uniform
Height of a red-black tree
	Let h be the black height of a red black tree on n nodes
	n is smallest when all the nodes are black . In this case tree is a complete binary tree of height h and n=pow(2,h)-1
	n is largest when all the alternate levels of tree are red then height of tree is 2h and n = pow(2,2h)-1;
	log4(n) < h < 1+log2(n)
Redblack trees to 2-4 trees
	Any red-black tree can be converted into 2-4 tree
	Take a black node and its red children(atmost 2) and combine them into one node of a 2-4 tree
	Each node so formed has atleast 1 and atmost 3 keys
	Since black height of all external nodes is same,in the resulting 2-4 tree all leaves are at same level
2-4 trees to Red-black trees
	Any 2-4 tree can be converted into a red-black tree
	We replace a node of the 2-4 tree with one black node and 0/1/2 red nodes which are children of the black node
	The height of the 2-4 tree is the black height of the red-black tree created
	Every red node has a black child
Deletion
	To delete a node we proceed as in BST ie we search for the node first
	The node which is deleted is the parent of an external node
	Hence it is either a leaf or the parent of the leaf
	There might be 3 scenerios
		The node to be deleted is a leaf red node
		The node to be deleted might be a leaf black node
		The node could be a black node with left red only child
			The red cannot have black children because the right child is a external node and there would a black height problems
		Case tricky
			when the leaf node is a black node
			Removing this reduces black depth of an external node by 1
			Hence in a general step we consider how to reorganize the tree when the black height of some subtree goes down from h to h-1
