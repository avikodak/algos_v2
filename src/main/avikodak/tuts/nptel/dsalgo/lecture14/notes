Red black trees
    A red black tree is a binary search tree in which each node is colored red or black
    The root is colored black
    A red node can have only black children
    If a node of the BST does not have a left and/or right child we add an external node
    External nodes are not colored
    The black depth of an external node is defined as the number of black ancestors it has
    In a red black tree every external node has the same black depth
Two prolems
Double red problem
    Two reds occuring consecutively
Black height not uniform
Height of a red-black tree
    Let h be the black height of a red black tree on n nodes
    n is smallest when all the nodes are black . In this case tree is a complete binary tree of height h and n=pow(2,h)-1
    n is largest when all the alternate levels of tree are red then height of tree is 2h and n = pow(2,2h)-1;
    log4(n) < h < 1+log2(n)
Redblack trees to 2-4 trees
    Any red-black tree can be converted into 2-4 tree
    Take a black node and its red children(atmost 2) and combine them into one node of a 2-4 tree
    Each node so formed has atleast 1 and atmost 3 keys
    Since black height of all external nodes is same,in the resulting 2-4 tree all leaves are at same level
2-4 trees to Red-black trees
    Any 2-4 tree can be converted into a red-black tree
    We replace a node of the 2-4 tree with one black node and 0/1/2 red nodes which are children of the black node
    The height of the 2-4 tree is the black height of the red-black tree created
    Every red node has a black child
Deletion
    To delete a node we proceed as in BST ie we search for the node first
    The node which is deleted is the parent of an external node
    Hence it is either a leaf or the parent of the leaf
    There might be 3 scenerios
        The node to be deleted is a leaf red node
        The node to be deleted might be a leaf black node
        The node could be a black node with left red only child
            The red cannot have black children because the right child is a external node and there would a black height problems
        Case tricky
            when the leaf node is a black node
            Removing this reduces black depth of an external node by 1
            Hence in a general step we consider how to reorganize the tree when the black height of some subtree goes down from h to h-1
