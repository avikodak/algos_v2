AVL Trees
	AVL trees are balanced
	An AVL Tree is a binary search tree is a binary search tree such that for every internal node v of T the heights of the children of v can differ by atmost by 1
Height of an AVL Tree
	Proposition 
		The height of an AVL tree T storing n keys is O(logn)
	Justification
		The easiest way to approach above proposition is to find n(h) : The minimum number of nodes in an AVL tree of height h
		We see that n(1) = 1 and n(2) = 2
		For h >= 3 , an AVL tree of height h contains the root node , one AVL subtree of heoght h-1 and the other AVL subtree of height h-1 or h-2
		so n(h) = 1 + n(h-1) + n(h-2)
		Knowing n(h-1) >= n(h-2) we get
			n(h) = n(h-1) + n(h-2) + 1 > 2n(h-2)
			n(h) > 2n(h-2)
				 > 4n(h-4)
				 > pow(2,i) * n(h-2*i)
			When i = h/2 - 1 we get n(h) > pow(2,h/2-1)*n(2) = pow(2,h/2)
			Taking logs
				h < 2*log(n(h))
			Thus the height of the AVL tree is O(logn)\
		We will show how to obtain a sharper bound on the height of an AVL ree
		We prove using induction that the minimum number of nodes in an AVL Tree of height h , n(h) >= pow(c,h-1) where c is some number > 1
			Base case h=1 n(h) = 1
			Suppose claim is true for all h < k
			n(k) = n(k-1) + n(k-2) + 1
				 >= n(k-1) + n(k-2)
				 >= pow(c,k-1) + pow(c,k-2)
			We will be able to show that n(k) >= pow(c,k) if we can show that pow(c,k-1) + pow(c,k-2) >= pow(c,k)
			So c should be such that pow(c,2)-c-1 <= 0
			The quadratic equation has roots (1-sqrt(5))/2 and (1+sqrt(5))/2
			Hence we can take c as (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = 1.63
	 		n(h) >= pow(1.63,h-1)
	 		h <= log(n)tobase1.63
	 		
Structure of an AVL tree
	Consider an AVL tree on n nodes
	Consider a leaf which is closest to the root
	Suppose this leaf is at level k
	Then the height of the tree is atmost 2k-1
	Claim : Since closest leaf is at level k all nodes at levels 1...k-2 have 2 children
		Check for height balance property
	All levels 1 to k-1 are full
	Hence the tree has at least pow(2,k-1) nodes
	Since height of tree is at most 2k-1 it has atmost pow(2,2k-1)
	So	pow(2,k-1) <= n <= pow(2,2k-1)
	Substituting h for 2k-1 we get
	pow(2,(h-1)/2)<=n<=pow(2,h)
	So it has exponential no of nodes	
Summary
	In an AVL tree of height h the leaf closest to the root is at level is atleast (h+1)/2
	On the first h-1/2 levels the AVL tree is a complete binary tree 
	Number of nodes in the AVL tree is atleast pow(2,(h-1)/2) <= n <= pow(2,h)
	After (h-1)/2 levels the AVL tree may start thinning out
Insertion
	A binary tree T is called height-balanced if for every node v, height of v's children differ by atmost 1
