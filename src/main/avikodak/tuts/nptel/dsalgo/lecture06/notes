        Root
        Node 
        Parent
        Great grand parent
        Siblings
        Ancestors
        Descendants
        Leaves
        Children
        External Nodes
        Internal Nodes
    Depth/Level of a Node
    Height of a tree 
        Max depth of the nodes
    Usuage
        A tree represents a hierarchy for 
        Examples 
            The organization structure of an corporation
            Table of contents of book
            File systems
    Ordered Tree 
        It is a tree in which children of each node are ordered
    Binary tree
        Ordered tree with all nodes having at most 2 children
    Recursive definition of binary tree
        A binary tree is either a 
            leaf
            internal node (the root) and one/two binary trees (left subtree and/or right subtree)
        Ex    
            Arithematic Expressions
            Decision trees 
    Complete Binary Tree
        Level i has pow(2,i) nodes
        In a tree of height h
            Leaves are at level h
            No of leaves in pow(2,h)
            No of internal nodes = pow(2,h) - 1
            No of internal nodes = no of leaves -1
            Total no of nodes pow(2,h+1)-1 = n
        In a tree of n nodes
            No of leaves is (n+1)/2
            Height = log(no of leaves)
        No of leaves is very large 
    A binary tree can be obtained from an appropriate complete binary tree by pruning
    A binary tree of height h has 
        At most pow(2,i) nodes at level i
        At most 1 + 2 + pow(2,2) + pow(2,3) + ... + pow(2,h) = pow(2,h+1)-1 nodes
    If a tree has n nodes then
        n <= pow(2,h+1)-1
        h >= log((n+1)/2)
    A binary tree on n nodes has height at most n-1 which is obtained when every node has exactly one child
        log((n+1)/2) <= h <= n-1
    No of leaves <= 1+no of internal nodes    
    For a binary tree on n nodes
        no of leaves + no of internal nodes = n
        no of leaves <= no of internal nodes + 1
        no of leaves <= (n+1)/2
        Minimum no of leaves is 1
ADTs for Trees
    Generic container methods
        size
        isEmpty
        elements - Gives all values
    Positional container methods
        positions - Gives all positions of tree 
        swapElements - Swapping two positions
        replaceElement
    Query methods
        isRoot
        isInternal
        isExternal
    Accessor methods
        root() : returns the position of the root
        parent(p) returs parent of the node
        children(p) returs children of the node
    Binary Tree
        leftChild(p)
        rightChild(p)
        siblings(p_
    Each node in the tree contains
        key - key
        left - pointer to left child
        right - ptr to right child
        parent - ptr to parent node
