Tree
	Definitions
		Root
		Node 
		Parent
		Great grand parent
		Siblings
		Ancestors
		Descendants
		Leaves
		Children
		External Nodes
		Internal Nodes
	Depth/Level of a Node
	Height of a tree 
		Max depth of the nodes
	Usuage
		A tree represents a hierarchy for 
		Examples 
			The organization structure of an corporation
			Table of contents of book
			File systems
	Ordered Tree 
		It is a tree in which children of each node are ordered
	Binary tree
		Ordered tree with all nodes having at most 2 children
	Recursive definition of binary tree
		A binary tree is either a 
			leaf
			internal node (the root) and one/two binary trees (left subtree and/or right subtree)
		Ex	
			Arithematic Expressions
			Decision trees 
	Complete Binary Tree
		Level i has pow(2,i) nodes
		In a tree of height h
			Leaves are at level h
			No of leaves in pow(2,h)
			No of internal nodes = pow(2,h) - 1
			No of internal nodes = no of leaves -1
			Total no of nodes pow(2,h+1)-1 = n
		In a tree of n nodes
			No of leaves is (n+1)/2
			Height = log(no of leaves)
		No of leaves is very large 
	A binary tree can be obtained from an appropriate complete binary tree by pruning
	A binary tree of height h has 
		At most pow(2,i) nodes at level i
		At most 1 + 2 + pow(2,2) + pow(2,3) + ... + pow(2,h) = pow(2,h+1)-1 nodes
	If a tree has n nodes then
		n <= pow(2,h+1)-1
		h >= log((n+1)/2)
	A binary tree on n nodes has height at most n-1 which is obtained when every node has exactly one child
		log((n+1)/2) <= h <= n-1
	No of leaves <= 1+no of internal nodes	
	For a binary tree on n nodes
		no of leaves + no of internal nodes = n
		no of leaves <= no of internal nodes + 1
		no of leaves <= (n+1)/2
		Minimum no of leaves is 1
ADTs for Trees
	Generic container methods
		size
		isEmpty
		elements - Gives all values
	Positional container methods
		positions - Gives all positions of tree 
		swapElements - Swapping two positions
		replaceElement
	Query methods
		isRoot
		isInternal
		isExternal
	Accessor methods
		root() : returns the position of the root
		parent(p) returs parent of the node
		children(p) returs children of the node
	Binary Tree
		leftChild(p)
		rightChild(p)
		siblings(p_
	Each node in the tree contains
		key - key
		left - pointer to left child
		right - ptr to right child
		parent - ptr to parent node
Unbounded Tree
	Parent 
	Leftchild
	RightSiblings
