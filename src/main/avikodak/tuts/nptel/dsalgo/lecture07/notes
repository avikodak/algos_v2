Tree walks/traversals    
    A tree walk or traversal is a way of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specified order
    A preorder tree walk processes the node before processing its children
    A postorder tree walk processes each node after processing its children
Preorder traversal
    Algo preOrder(v)
        visit node v
        for each child w of v
            preOrder(w)
    Ex
        Reading a book
Postorder traversal
    Algo postOrder(v)
        for each child w of v
            postOrder(w)
        visit node v
    Ex
        Directory space size 
            du (disk usuage) size of the tree
    Arithematic expressions
Inorder traversal
    When v is visited between the visits to the left and right subtree
    Algo inorder(v)
        inorder(v.left)
        visit
        inorder(v.right)
Euler traversal
    if(external)
        visit
        return;
    visit(v)
    Eulertraversal(v.left)
    visit(v)
    EulerTraversal(v.right)
Given pre and post order traversal of a binary tree we cannot uniquely identify the tree
This is because there can be two trees with same post and pre order traversals
Special case
    If each internal node of the internal node of the binary tree has at least two children then the tree can be determined from the pre and post order traversals
