Tree walks/traversals	
	A tree walk or traversal is a way of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specified order
	A preorder tree walk processes the node before processing its children
	A postorder tree walk processes each node after processing its children
Preorder traversal
	Algo preOrder(v)
		visit node v
		for each child w of v
			preOrder(w)
	Ex
		Reading a book
Postorder traversal
	Algo postOrder(v)
		for each child w of v
			postOrder(w)
		visit node v
	Ex
		Directory space size 
			du (disk usuage) size of the tree
	Arithematic expressions
Inorder traversal
	When v is visited between the visits to the left and right subtree
	Algo inorder(v)
		inorder(v.left)
		visit
		inorder(v.right)
Euler traversal
	if(external)
		visit
		return;
	visit(v)
	Eulertraversal(v.left)
	visit(v)
	EulerTraversal(v.right)
Given pre and post order traversal of a binary tree we cannot uniquely identify the tree
This is because there can be two trees with same post and pre order traversals
Special case
	If each internal node of the internal node of the binary tree has at least two children then the tree can be determined from the pre and post order traversals
