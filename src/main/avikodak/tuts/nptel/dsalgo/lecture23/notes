More Sorting
Radix Sort
	Unlike other sorting methods radix sort considers the structure of keys
	Assume keys are represented in base M number system M=radix i.e if M = 2 the keys are represented in binary
	Sorting is done by comparing bits in same position
	Extension to keys that are alphanumeric strings
Radix Exchange Sort
	Examine bits from left to right
		Sort array with respect to leftmost bit
		Partition array
		Recursion
			Recursively sort top subarray ignoring leftmost bit
			Recursively sort bottom subarray ignoring leftmost bit
		Time to sort n b-bit numbers O(b*n)
			T(n,b) = T(i,b-1) + T(n-i,b-1)
		algo for partition
			repeat
				scan top-down to find key starting with 1
				scan bottom-up to find key starting with 0
				exchange keys
			until scan indices cross
Radix exchange sort vs Quick sort
	Similarities
		both partition array
		borh recursively sort sub-arrays
	Differences
		Method of partitioning
			Radix exchange divides array based on greater than or less than pow(2,b-1)
			Quicksort partitions based on greater than or less than some element of the array
		Time Complexity
			Radix exchange O(b*n)
			Quick sort O(n*logn)
Straight radix sort
	Examine bits right to left (from least significant bit to most significant bit
	for k=0 to b-1
		sort the array in a stable way
		looking only at bit k
	In a stable sort the initial relative order of keys is unchanged 
Correctness of algorithm
	We show that any two keys are in the correct relative order at the end of the algorithms
	Given two keys let k be the leftmost bit-position where they differ
		01011
		01101
		  k
	At step k the two keys are put in the correct relative order . Because of stability the successive steps do not change the relative order of the two keys
Straight radix sort time complexity
	for k=0 to b-1
		sort the array in a stable way looking only at bit k
	Suppose we can perform the stable sort above in O(n) time
	Then the time complexity would be 
		O(b*n)
Bucket sort
	n numbers
	Each number which belongs to set 1,2,3,4 ... m
	Stable sort
	This is useful when the userinputs come from a small range
	Time O(n+m)
	First we create M buckets
	Each element of the array is put in the one of the m buckets
In place sorting
	A sorting algorithm is said to be in place if
		it uses no auxiliary data structures (however O(1) auxiliary variables are allowed)
		It updates the input sequence only by means of operations replaceElement and swapElement

Lower bound for comparison based sorting
	internal node : comparison
	external node : permutation
	algorithm execution : root to leaf path
