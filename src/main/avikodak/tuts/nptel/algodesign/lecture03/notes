RAM (Random access machine) Vs Real Computer
    Real computers have much more complicated structure
        Many different kinds of memory
        Pipelining / Superscalar
        Memory - Register copy instructions
        Arithematic / Any computation is only done in registers
        Compiler intelligence
General analysis strategy
    T(n) : Max amount of time taken by algorithm A for an input sequence of size n
    Conservative definition - worst case measure
    Rather than giving the precise number mathematical model gives the functional form for the t(n)
    T(n) for larger bound
    Apart from worst case scnerio we might also consider calculating average time taken but often these are pretty hard to compute
