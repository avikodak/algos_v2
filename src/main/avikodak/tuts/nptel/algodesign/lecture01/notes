Overview of course
==================    
    Approach
        Analytical
        Build a mathematical model of a computer
        Study properties of algos on the model
    GCD
        Algo 1
        ======
            Find factors of first number
            Find factors of second number
            Return the common factors
        
        Algo 2
        ======
        Euclid Algo
            while m not divides n
                reminder = n % m;
                n = m
                m = remainder
        The sum of the numbers in the euclids inputs always reduces atleast by 3/2
        So from the above fact we can say that the loop eventually terminates
        To design faster algorithms we need to know the computation of the existing algos
