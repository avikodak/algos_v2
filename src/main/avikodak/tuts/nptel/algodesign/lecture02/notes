Framework for algorithms analysis
=================================
    The framework can also be used for other resources as well(memory etc) apart from the computations
    Basic idea is to develop a mathematical model of a computer , mentally execute the algorithm and evaluate the execution time
    Time of execution of the algorithm will depend on the input instance provided for example in case of quick sort / insertion sort
    Basic terminology
        Problem : Specification of what are valid inputs and what is the acceptable outputs for inputs
        Input instance : A valid input value for a given problem
        Size of the input instance : The number of bits required to represent the given input ( formal def )
            Any parameter which grows roughly with the formal notion of size ( informal def )
        Algorithm:
            An abstract computational procedure which converts the given input and produces the required output
        Program:
            Implementation of an algorithm
        Pseudo code
    Mathematical model of a computer
        RAM : Random access machine
        It consists a processor and a memory
        Memory is a array of locations which has address assigned to each location
        Instruction set
            Arithematic and logical
            Jumps and conditional jumps
            Pointer instructions + Array operations
