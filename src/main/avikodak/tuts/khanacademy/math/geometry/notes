Geometry
========
Ray
	Starts from one points and goes on forever in one direction
Plane
	It is defined by 3 non collinear points
Coplanar points
	If all points lie on same plane
Circle
	Set of points which are equidistant from a point in a 2d plane
	Distance between center to any point on circle is called as radius
	Tangent
		A line which has only one common point with a circle
	Secant
		A line which has only two points in common with a circle
	Chord
		A line segment which connects two points on circle
	Diameter
		A chord which passes through center of circle
	Arc 
		A part of circle two points
Angles
	How wide the intersection is
	Measured in degrees and radians 
Adjacent angles
	Angles which have a common arm
Vertical angles
	If two lines intersect the angles which are not adjacent to each other are vertical angles
Linear pair
	Angle which are adjacent 
Angles in a polygons
	(S-2)*180 for a 'S' sided polygon - Sum of the interior angles of a polygon
	Sum of exterior angles in a polygon is 360
Supplementary
	Sum of angles = 180
Complementary
	Sum of angles = 90
Parallel lines
	Lines which do not intersect
Traversal
	Line which intersect two lines
Congruence
	Geometrical figures which have same size and shape
	Obtained by shifting flip rotate
	Corresponding angles and sides are congruent
Axiom
	Self evident
	Assumption
SSS congruence
	Two triangles and if corresponding sides are equal then the triangles are congruent
SAS - congruence
ASA - congruence
AAS - congruence

AAA similarity
Similarity
SSA != congruent nor similarity (Only if A is obtuse or right angle then SSA congruent postulate)
	One figure is obtained from another by rotating shifting fliping dilate
	All corresponding angles are congruent and sides are scaled up or down by a same scale factor
	AA
	SAS - ratio of corresponding sides are proportion and the angle between them is same 
	SSS - ratio of corresponding sides are in proportion
Trigonometry

Areas and perimeter
	Diagonals divide the rectangle divide into 4 triangles of equal area
	Area of equilateral triangle = sqrt(3)/4 * a^2
	Herons Formulae = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) s = (a+b+c)/2
	
Cirle
	Angle subtended by an arc at center = 2 * angle subtended by same arc at the other side of arc
	The tangent of the circle will make an angle of 90 with the linesegment joining the point where tangent meets the circle and to the center

Circumcenter
	Circle formed by perpendicular bisector of the sides
	Circumcenter of the right triangle = mid point of the hypotenuse
	Three non collinear points define a unique triangle
	Each unique triangle has a unique circumcenter
	Every point on the perpendicular bisector of the linesegment is equidistant from the end points
	Area of triangle = (abc)/4R R = circum radius

Angle bisectors	
	Any point on angular bisectors is equidistant from its arm
	Area of triangle = 1/2 * inradius * perimeter 

Angle bisector theorem - Important
	
Median
	A line segment that joins the vertex of the triangle to the midpoint on the opposite side
	All the three medians in a triangle meet at a point is called Centroid
	Centroid divides the median in the ratio to 2:1
	Medians divide the triangles into equal areas
	Medial triangle (triangle formed by midpoints) divide the larger triangle into 4 triangles into equal areas
