Functions
=========
	Even function
		Symmetry around the y-axis
		f(-x) = f(x)
		Ex : f(x) = x^2
	Odd function	
		Reflected first around the y-axis and then on x-axis
		f(-x) = -f(x)
		Ex : f(x) = x^3
			 f(x) = x
		Odd function would go through origin
Local minimum
	Minimum point local interval
Palindrome = even function
Any non zero divided by zero is undefined
 1/0.1 = 10 , 1/0.01 = 100 so we might tempt to say 1/0 = +infinity
but when we take negative numbers
	-1/0.1 = -10 , -1/0.01 = -100 so it can also be - infinity
	so they declared that division by zero is undefined
Undefined - leads to contradiction
Indeterminate - multiple values can be satisfied 

Polynomial and rational functions
=================================
Discriminant = sqrt(b^2-4ac)
D > 0 Two distinct real roots
D = 0 Equal roots
D < 0 No real solutions

Remainder theorem
Synthetic division
	- Works only when the denominator is of the form x+/-c

x^3 + y^3 = (x+y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)
a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)

End behaviour
	ax^2 + bx + c 
	ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
	Even degree polynomial has end behaviour similar to second degree polynomial
	Odd degree polynomial has end behaviour similar to third degree polynomial
	
Binomial Theorem
(a+b)^n =  sigma(ncr * x^n-r * y^r)

Asymptotes
	Lines where graph never touches but gets closer and closer
Partial fraction expansion
	Rational function (Expression divided by another)
	Requirements
		Numerator should have lower degree than denominator
	Algebratic expression = a / denominator factor + b /denominator factor
	

Fundamental Theorem of algebra
	The nth degree of polynomial have exact n roots which may be complex or real roots
	Odd degree polynomial has atleast one real root
	
	
Exponential and logarithmic functions
=====================================
	Very fast growth
	y = pow(c,x) 
	The general form of exponential function is c * pow(a,x) a and c are constants

Interest
========
	Rent on money
	Simple interest = p*t*r/100

Logarithms
==========
 	The logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value, the base, must be raised to produce that number
 
Complex Numbers
===============
	i = sqrt(-1) is not usually accepted definition
	sqrt(a*b) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) // Both a and b are negative simultaneously
	Any complex number times conjugate is real numbers
	Absolute value of complex numbers (distance away from zero) = sqrt(a^2+b^2)
Matrices
========
	Rectangular array of numbers
	Transpose
		Rows become columns and column becomes rows
	Matrix multiplication is not commutative
