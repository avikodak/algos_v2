Algebra
---------------------------------------------------
Abstractness
    
Rene descrates
    - Built relationship between algebra and geometry
    - 2d (updown and leftright)
    - cartesian co-ordinates

Order of operations
    PEMDAS - Parenthesis , Exponents , Multiplication/Division , Addition/Subtraction
    If at same level then perform operation from left to right

pow(0,0) - undefined 

Dimensional Analysis 
    Units follow algebraic rules
    
Slope intercept form y = mx + c
Point slope form y-b = m(x-a) slope=m and pass throught point (a,b)
Standard form ax+by = c // All variables on one side and constants on other sides

Fitting the line - linear regression

Any linear equation can be written in y = mx+c

Break even point means profit = loss

Slope of perpendicular line is -1/m

Slope of parallel line is m (Parallel lines slopes are equal)

Distance between point and line
    
Average rate of change = slope of line in the end points in interval

System of equations and inequalities
====================================
Solve equation by substitution,Graphing,Ellimination
Consistent systems - atleast one solution
Inconsistent system - No solution     
    Same slope different y-intercept
Dependent system -
    same slope and same intercept

Multiplying and factoring expressions
=====================================
Monomial one term in polynomial
Multiply binomials same as numbers
Foil - First ,Outside,Inside,Last
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 + b^2

Factoring is nothing but the reverse of distributive property
Polynomial
===========
Nonnegative exponents and integer
Degree :
    The highest exponent
Standard form : decreasing powers

Discriment
==========
    b2-4ac > 0 real roots
    b2-4ac = 0 equal roots /only one root
    b2-4ac < 0 complex roots 

Quadratic polynomial
====================
    ax^2+bx+c
    
Vertex form
    y = A(X-B)^2 + C // Complete the full square
    Vertex it (B,C) because the minimum value of the square is when the (X-B)^2 = 0
    If the coefficient of the x square is negative then parabola is opening down else opening up
    Vertex is the mid point of the zeros of the equation
    Y = X^2 (Passes through origin and opens up)
    Y = (X-H)^2 (Shifted the vertex in horizontal direction)
    Y-K = X^2 (shifiting the vertex in vertical direction)
    Y = -X^2 (Has origin as vertex and opens downwards)
    
Exponents expression and equations
==================================
a^-b = 1/(a^b)
(ab)^n = a^n * b^n
(a/b)^n = a^n / b^n
(a^m)^n = a^mn

Direct Variation
================
    y = kx
        y varies directly with x then also
        x varies directly with x
    y = kx + c is neither a direct nor inverse variation
Inverse variation
=================
    y = k/x
        y varies inversely with x then
        x varies inversely with y
Joint variation
===============
    Deals with more than two variables
        A = l * b 
Exponential function
===================
    y = c^x
Functions
    It is nothing but a black box which gives some output based on input
    maps elements in domain to elements in range
    (f/g)(x) = f(x)/g(x)
    (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
    (f*g)(x) = f(x) * g(x)
    (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)
Inverse of a function
=====================
    Inverse function takes back from value in range to domain
    maps element from the range to domain
    function is not invertible
    It is a reflection on y = x    
Golden ratio
============
x = 1 + 1/x - can be recursive called a/b = (a+b)/a
x^2 = x + 1
x^2 - x - 1 = 0
    (1+sqrt(5))/2
Product of rational number is a rational numbers
Sum of rational number is a rational number
Product of rational and irrational number is a irrational number
Sum of rational number and irrational number is a irrational number
Square root of any prime number is irrational number
Product / sum of two irrational number can be either a rational number or irrational number
Between any two rational number you can atleast find one irrational number
