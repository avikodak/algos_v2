Algebra
---------------------------------------------------
Abstractness
	
Rene descrates
	- Built relationship between algebra and geometry
	- 2d (updown and leftright)
	- cartesian co-ordinates

Order of operations
	PEMDAS - Parenthesis , Exponents , Multiplication/Division , Addition/Subtraction
	If at same level then perform operation from left to right

pow(0,0) - undefined 

Dimensional Analysis 
	Units follow algebraic rules
	
Slope intercept form y = mx + c
Point slope form y-b = m(x-a) slope=m and pass throught point (a,b)
Standard form ax+by = c // All variables on one side and constants on other sides

Fitting the line - linear regression

Any linear equation can be written in y = mx+c

Break even point means profit = loss

Slope of perpendicular line is -1/m

Slope of parallel line is m (Parallel lines slopes are equal)

Distance between point and line
	
Average rate of change = slope of line in the end points in interval

System of equations and inequalities
====================================
Solve equation by substitution,Graphing,Ellimination
Consistent systems - atleast one solution
Inconsistent system - No solution 	
	Same slope different y-intercept
Dependent system -
	same slope and same intercept

Multiplying and factoring expressions
=====================================
Monomial one term in polynomial
Multiply binomials same as numbers
Foil - First ,Outside,Inside,Last
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 + b^2

Factoring is nothing but the reverse of distributive property
Quadratic polynomial
====================
